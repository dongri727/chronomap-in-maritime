  "infoA": "This is an application specialized in the input and output of data related to the maritime events from the \"ChronoMap\". The \"ChronoMap\" is a database that encompasses all historical events from the origin of the universe to the endless 'now,' without regard to field. It aims to accurately display temporal and spatial distances, with 'when' and 'where' as mandatory items.",
  "infoB": "Web version of \"ChronoMap\"",
  "infoC": "Web version of 3Dl and 4D views",
  "infoD": "How to use the \"ChronoMap\"",
  "infoE": "This app does not acquire any of your personal information, nor does it track or use information on your device.",
  "infoF": "The historical information you register is not linked to you. There are no records of what you register or search for.",
  "infoG": "Information contrary to the purpose of the \"ChronoMap\" will be handled by the administrator as follows.\n1. Correction\n2. Viewing stop (may be made public in the future)\n3. Deletion",
  "infoH": "The historical information you register is treated as a public good, and you yourself cannot delete it. Please be careful not to write personal information. If you want to delete information registered by mistake or find information that should be deleted, please contact the following address.",
  "infoI": "We are looking for people to join us in developing the \"ChronoMap.\" If you are an engineer who can handle Flutter, AWS, PostgreSQL, Unity, etc., or can assist with data entry and correction, please contact us below.",
  "scalableA": "This page plots and displays maritime events registered in the database on an adjustable timeline. When you register data, it will be reflected in real-time.",
  "scalableB": "Step 1\nBe sure to press the Get button to obtain data.",
  "scalableC": "Step 2\nThe 7 options at the bottom allow you to select the initial display area. You can scroll through the entire timeline after the initial display.",
  "scalableD": "The logarithmic timeline is set with the year 2100 as the base, with time flowing from top to bottom. Events are fixed on the timeline, so events that occurred close in time are displayed near each other, while events that occurred over a longer span of time are displayed further apart. Zooming in will show details of events from the same era, while zooming out provides an overview of longer periods.",
  "scalableE": "If you find any events plotted in the wrong position, please contact us at the following.",
  "addHintA": "In the \"ChronoMap\" a historical event refers to a singular occurrence equipped with \"when\" and \"where\" information. For instance, \"Columbus's quest for a sea route to India\" is not considered a singular event. A proper entry would look like: \"October 12, 1492, Columbus reaches Guanahani Island in the West Indies, Bahamas, San Salvador Island.\"",
  "addHintB": "To associate events and perform searches effectively, make use of search tags. Tap \"Show Tags\" to view existing tags. You can select one or multiple tags.",

  "addHintD": "For the \"WHEN\" section, first choose the unit using the dropdown button, then enter the year, month, and day. If the month or day is unknown, enter 0. However, note that events with month and day set to 0 may not retain the correct chronological order with other events in the same year.",
  "addHintE": "For the \"WHERE\" section, start by selecting a country name or ocean name, then add a place name or sea area name. While country and ocean names cannot be added, place names and sea area names can be. When you enter a new name, the \"Add\" button will appear. Tap it to add the name to the list of options, then select it.",
  "addHintF": "Latitude and longitude should be entered in decimal format. There is no need to include a minus sign for southern latitude or western longitude. Events with latitude and longitude will be reflected immediately on all display screens. If latitude and longitude are not entered, the event will only be displayed on the Stretchable Timeline and CLASSIC view.",
